# kraidGUI
GUI framework implemented in Lua. Can be used with different backends, a löve2d backend is developed alongside it by me.

kraidGUI is made for programmers who want to make a GUI and should be a framework to easily change the appereance/behaviour of widgets or add custom ones without much work.
In essence it is supposed to be the starting point for any GUI programmed in Lua with a default implementation of a dark design and a backend for löve2D, though any backend can easily plugged into it.

This project is quite a beast, so I never really took the time to write documentation. I don't use it much nowadays anyways, but if you are absolutely sure kraidGUI is exactly what you need and want to use it for something cool, hit me up and I might come back to it!
